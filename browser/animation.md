# Animation

## Safari

### Height

The animation of heights is super buggy in Safari. The whole page is getting slow and the animation looks super ugly. This behaviour is only happening in Safari. Other browsers are rendering the height change without any performance problems. I found a bug related to webkit which is not being fixed since several months.
